# Extended Maps

The `Extended Map` mode enables resource interoperability across multiple sub-maps, covering resources such as `code`, `models`, `images`, `UI interfaces`, `data spaces`, `player skins`, `shops`, and `audio` resources. It is designed to significantly enhance development efficiency and flexibility.

## Advantages of Extended Maps

### 1. Resource Interoperability and Efficient Management

- **Resource Sharing**: Through extended maps, resources can be shared among different sub-maps, making it convenient for creators to manage and access all resources on a unified platform.
- **Convenient Management**: Centralized resource management simplifies the development process and reduces the time cost of finding and integrating resources.

### 2. Improved Development Efficiency

- **Quick Resource Location**: Creators can quickly find the required resources within the extended map without having to switch back and forth between different sub-maps.
- **Reduced Redundant Work**: Extended maps can avoid the repeated creation and storage of resources, thereby reducing redundancy and errors in the development process.

### 3. Enhanced Development Flexibility

- **Diverse Resource Support**: Extended maps cover a variety of resource types, providing creators with a rich selection of materials.
- **Custom Development**: Creators can create and modify resources in the extended map according to their own needs, achieving more personalized development.

### 4. Optimized User Experience

- **Resource Optimization**: Extended maps can integrate and optimize resources to ensure the smooth operation of games or applications.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on user preferences and behavior data, extended maps can provide personalized resource recommendations, enhancing the user experience.
