# Data Space Permissions

To address the issue that the Arena data space cannot be operated visually, the back-end developers have specially created a remote operation function for the data space in VSCode. The `data space` here specifically refers to the corresponding function in the Arena resource manager, which allows users to manage their data visually on the edit end.
