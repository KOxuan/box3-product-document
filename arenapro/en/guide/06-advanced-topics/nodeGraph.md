# Escaping the Code Labyrinth: See Through Your Project with a Dependency Graph

## Have You Ever Been Lost in a "Code Labyrinth"?

Imagine this scenario:

> You take over a large, complex project, or your own project has become a tangled mess after long-term iteration. Now, you want to modify a core file, like `PlayerManager.ts`.
>
> Your heart is filled with fear and uncertainty:
>
> - "How many files actually reference `PlayerManager.ts`?"
> - "If I change this, will it break features in a dozen other places?"
> - "How is this project even organized? I feel like I'm fumbling through a maze without a map."

This feeling is a nightmare for many developers when facing a complex codebase. Wouldn't it be great to have a "God's-eye view" map that instantly shows you the entire "code skeleton" of the project?

The **File Dependency Graph** feature built into ArenaPro is the "detective map" you've been looking for to crack the code labyrinth.

## What Can This "Detective Map" Tell You?

A file dependency graph is a visualization tool that treats each file in the project as a "location" and the `import` relationships between files as connecting "roads," intuitively displaying the structure of the entire project.

With this map, you can instantly become a "code detective" and easily discover:

| What You Can Discover...  | What It Means...                                                                                                                      |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **📍 Traffic Hubs**       | A "core module" referenced by many files; be extra careful when modifying it.                                                         |
| **🚫 Circular Dead Ends** | Several files reference each other, forming a "circular dependency." This is a classic "code smell" that needs to be refactored soon. |
| **🏝️ Island Code**        | Some files are not referenced by any other files; they might be "dead code" that can be safely deleted.                               |
| **🗺️ A Clear Blueprint**  | Helps new team members quickly understand the project's macro-architecture instead of diving headfirst into code details.             |

## How to Get and Use Your "Map"

### One-Click Map Generation

We provide the most convenient VS Code command links. Clicking them will directly draw the "code map" for your server-side code:

👉 **[Draw Server-Side Code Dependency Graph](vscode://box3lab.box3arenapro/command?type=ap.file.server.script.graph)**

👉 **[Draw Client-Side Code Dependency Graph](vscode://box3lab.box3arenapro/command?type=ap.file.client.script.graph)**

### Manual Map Summoning

You can also summon it manually via the Command Palette:

1.  Press `F1` (or `Shift+Ctrl+P` / `Shift+Cmd+P`) to open the Command Palette.
2.  Type `Graph` to search.
3.  Select the `Get Server/Client Entry File Dependency Graph` option.

### Map Interaction Guide

This map is fully interactive:

| Action Type           | Instructions                                                                       |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **🔍 Zoom**           | Use the mouse wheel to zoom freely.                                                |
| **🖐️ Pan**            | Press and drag a "location" or the map background to adjust the layout.            |
| **ℹ️ View Details**   | Hover over a "location" to see the full file path.                                 |
| **📝 Quick Teleport** | **Click** on any "location" to open the corresponding file directly in the editor. |

**💡 Detective's Advice**: Regularly generate a dependency graph to give your project a "health check." This helps to identify structural problems early on, gradually turning your code labyrinth into a well-planned city.
