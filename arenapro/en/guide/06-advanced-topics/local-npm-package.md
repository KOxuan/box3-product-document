# Guide: Using Local Private NPM Packages in Your Team

This guide targets team-internal libraries (utils/ui/core, etc.) that are not publicly published. It explains how to use local, private packages in ArenaPro projects without pushing them to a public registry.

## When should you use a local package?

- You have reusable libraries shared across multiple maps/projects, but you don’t want to expose them publicly.
- You want fast iteration and validation without a full publish workflow.
- You need a reproducible installation process in CI/CD, while avoiding dependency on public registries.

## Option 1: `file:` dependency (simple and stable)

If your package folder sits nearby your project, point to it in your project’s `package.json` via `file:`.

1. Example structure:

```
my-project/              # your ArenaPro project
../my-utils/             # your local package (a sibling folder)
```

2. Declare the dependency in `my-project/package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "my-utils": "file:../my-utils"
  }
}
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

After installation, `node_modules/my-utils` will be a local link to `../my-utils` (not downloaded from the internet).

4. Use it in code:

```ts
// client/src/index.ts
import { clampToRange } from "my-utils";

export function heal(player, amount) {
  const hp = player.getData("hp");
  player.setData("hp", clampToRange(hp + amount, 0, 100));
}
```

- Pros: Simple, stable, works across platforms; CI/CD friendly.
- Cons: When editing `../my-utils`, you might need to restart the build or reinstall if caches don’t pick up changes.

> Tip: In your local package, set `"sideEffects": false` and export as ESM to enable better tree-shaking.

## Option 2: `npm pack` + install tarball

When you want to validate your package under conditions close to a real publish (e.g., ignored files, build outputs, `exports` field), package it into a tarball and install it.

1. In the local package directory:

```bash
npm pack
```

This generates a tarball like `my-utils-1.0.0.tgz`.

2. Install the tarball in the project directory:

```bash
npm install ../my-utils/my-utils-1.0.0.tgz
```

- Pros: Very close to real publish behavior; ideal for pre-publish self-testing.
- Cons: You need to repack and reinstall after each change.

## FAQ

- Import fails: `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`

  - Check that `exports`/`main` point to actual built outputs.
  - Ensure `type: "module"` and ESM entry are consistent.

- ESM/CJS incompatibility: `require is not defined` or `Cannot use import statement outside a module`

  - Standardize on ESM output, or provide both ESM/CJS via `exports` and prefer ESM in the project.

- Edits in the local package don’t take effect immediately

  - With `file:`: restart the build or reinstall; clear bundler caches.
  - With `npm pack`: re-run `npm pack` and reinstall the new `.tgz` in the project.

- Missing types: editor cannot find `.d.ts`
  - Add `"types": "dist/index.d.ts"` in `package.json` and ensure the file exists.

## Which option should I choose?

- Prefer `file:` for simple, stable, and out-of-the-box workflows.
- Prefer `npm pack` + tarball installation for pre-publish validation and CI/CD reproducibility.

> For distributed teams, non-co-located folders, or advanced access control, consider a private registry (e.g., Verdaccio / GitHub Packages / GitLab Package Registry). That follows a “private publish” route and is out of scope for this page.
