# Step 3: Connect to the Cloud

Your local project has been created. Now, we must complete the most critical step: linking it to your Shen Island account and the cloud map. Only then can you upload your code to the game.

This process consists of two steps: **① Log in to your account** -> **② Link the map**.

## 1️⃣ Log in to Your Shen Island Account

1. **Launch the Login Window**

   - In the bottom-right status bar of VS Code, locate and click the **orange** `Arena` icon.
   - Select `Log in to Shen Island Account` from the pop-up menu.

2. **Browser Authorization**: VS Code will automatically open your browser and redirect you to the Shen Island authorization page. Click "Allow" to grant permission.
3. **Login Successful**: Return to VS Code, and you’ll see the `Arena` icon in the status bar turn **green**, displaying your nickname.

## 2️⃣ Link the Extension Map

Once your account is logged in, we can bind this project to one of your maps.

1. **Start the Linking Wizard**: Press `F1` in VS Code, then enter and select the `Project Link Map Configuration` command.
2. **Select a Map**: VS Code will immediately display a list of all available **extension maps** under your account.
   - Choose the target map you want to link from the list.
   - If the map has multiple sub-maps, a secondary list will pop up for you to select the specific sub-map.
3. **Linking Successful**: After selection, the plugin will automatically write the map information into the project configuration file (`dao3.config.json`).

## ✅ Connection Successful

At this point, your local project is fully linked to the cloud map! All preparations are now complete.

Now, let’s officially begin the exciting coding phase. Please proceed to the next chapter: **[HelloWorld: Your First ArenaPro Program](../03-basic-tutorial/01-hello-world-tutorial.md)**.
