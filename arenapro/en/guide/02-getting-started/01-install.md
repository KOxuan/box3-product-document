# Step 1: Install the Development Environment

Welcome to the world of ArenaPro! Before you begin your creative journey, we need to set up a professional development environment. This chapter will guide you through installing all the necessary tools, laying a solid foundation for your future development work.

## üìã Environment Requirements

| Tool                | Version Requirement | Purpose                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **VS Code**         | `v1.9.0+`           | A professional tool for writing code and managing projects.                |
| **Node.js**         | `v20+`              | The basic runtime environment required for code compilation and packaging. |
| **ArenaPro Plugin** | Latest Version      | The core plugin connecting VS Code with the Box3 platform.                 |

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install VS Code (Visual Studio Code)

VS Code is a powerful and free code editor that will be your primary tool for writing code and managing projects.

> If you already have VS Code installed, you can skip to the next step.

1.  **Visit the official website**: Open the [VS Code official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2.  **Download and install**: Click the download button on the homepage to get the installer for your operating system, then follow the default settings to complete the installation.
3.  **Localize the editor (Optional)**: Click to install the [Simplified Chinese Language Pack](vscode:extension/MS-CEINTL.vscode-language-pack-zh-hans). After installation, click the prompt in the lower-right corner to switch the language.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Node.js

Node.js is the essential underlying environment that ArenaPro uses for important tasks like code compilation and packaging.

> If you already have Node.js installed, you can skip to the next step.

1.  **Visit the official website**: Open the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Download and install**: Click the download button on the homepage to get the installer for your operating system, then follow the default settings to complete the installation.

### Verify Installation

After installation, we need to verify it in the "Terminal." The terminal is a tool for interacting with your computer by typing text commands.

**The easiest way is to use the built-in terminal in VS Code:**

1.  Open VS Code.
2.  From the top menu bar, select `Terminal` > `New Terminal`.
3.  In the panel that appears at the bottom, type the following command and press Enter:

```bash
node -v
```

If you see a version number, it means you have successfully installed it.

> **‚ùì Command not found?**
> If the terminal reports that the `node` command is not found or cannot be recognized, it's usually because the system's environment variable (PATH) has not been refreshed after the new installation. Please try the following:
>
> 1.  **Restart VS Code**: Completely close all VS Code windows and then reopen it.
> 2.  If the problem persists, **restart your computer**. This will force the system to load all the latest configurations.

- **For Windows users**:
  - Press the `Win` key, type `cmd` or `PowerShell`, and then open it.
- **For macOS users**:
  - Find `Terminal` in the `Other` folder in `Launchpad`.
  - Or, press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and open it.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install the ArenaPro Creator Plugin

This is the final step. The ArenaPro plugin is the bridge connecting VS Code and the Box3 platform.

1.  **Open VS Code**.
2.  **Access the Extension Marketplace**: Click the "Extensions" icon (the four-square symbol) on the left sidebar of VS Code.
3.  **Search and install**: In the search box, type `ArenaPro Creator`, find the plugin, and click the "Install" button.
    - You can also click this link to install it directly: [Install ArenaPro Creator Plugin](vscode:extension/box3lab.box3arenapro).

![Search for and install the plugin in the Extension Marketplace](/QQ20240926-151900.png)

After the plugin is installed, it will automatically check if your Node.js version meets the requirements. If everything is fine, your development environment is now fully set up.

## ‚úÖ Installation Complete

Congratulations! You can now proceed to the next chapter to learn how to **[Create Your First ArenaPro Project](./02-create-project.md)**.

Your development environment is now ready. In the next guide, we will create our first ArenaPro project together.
