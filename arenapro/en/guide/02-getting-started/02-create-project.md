# Step 2: Create and Manage Your Project

With the environment set up, it's time to establish your creative base. A good habit of organizing folders will make your development journey much smoother.

## 1️⃣ Establish Your "Workspace"

We recommend that you first create a general "workspace" folder on your computer to uniformly store all your future ArenaPro projects. This is like creating a dedicated workshop for all your tools and blueprints, making them easy to manage and find.

1.  On your computer, choose a suitable location (e.g., "Documents" or D drive) and create a new folder to store all your Box3-related code projects.
2.  Name it, for example, `ArenaPro_Projects` or `MyGames`.
3.  **Open this folder in VS Code**:
    - Launch VS Code.
    - Go to the top menu bar `File` > `Open Folder`, and select the `ArenaPro_Projects` folder you just created.

:::warning
**⚠️ Folder Naming Convention**
Project names and paths **can only contain English letters, numbers, and underscores**. Do not use Chinese characters, spaces, or special symbols, as this will cause code compilation to fail later!

- **Correct example**: `my_awesome_game`
- **Incorrect example**: `我的超酷游戏` (My Awesome Game)

## 2️⃣ Create a New Project in the Workspace

Now that your VS Code window is focused on the workspace, let's create our first real project in this "workshop."

1.  **Launch the Project Wizard**:

    - Press the shortcut `F1` (or `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) to open the VS Code command palette.
    - Type **`New Arena-Ts Project`** and select the corresponding command.

2.  **Select a Project Template**:

    - In the options that appear, follow the prompts given by the wizard.
    - If you are asked `Ok to proceed? (y)`, **type `y` and press Enter** to continue.

3.  **Confirm Location and Name**:

    - The wizard will ask you to **select a parent folder** to store the project.
    - Next, name your project. In the input box that appears:
      - **Enter a new name (recommended)**: For example, `my_first_game`, then press Enter. This will create a new folder with the same name to store the project.
      - **Enter `.`**: If you want to place the project files directly in the currently open folder, type a period `.` and press Enter.

## ✅ Project Ready

Great! Your first project has been successfully created and is now open in VS Code. The file explorer will show the standard project structure:

- `client/` - Stores client-side code
- `server/` - Stores server-side code
- `dao3.config.json` - The project's configuration file
- ... other configuration files

Now, your local "arsenal" is ready. Next, we will connect it to the "battlefield" in the cloud.

:::tip Important Next Step: You Need an "Extended Map"
Before we connect your local project to the cloud, please ensure that you have **at least one "Extended Map"** under your Box3 account.

All of ArenaPro's powerful features (like code uploading, HMR hot reloading, breakpoint debugging, etc.) can only be used in an "Extended Map."

- If you don't have one yet, please go to the Box3 official website to create one first.
