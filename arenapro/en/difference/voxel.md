# Voxels

## Improvement Details

### Background of Modification

In the original official d.ts file, the voxel data for this API interface was broadly defined as `number` or `string` type, which could lead to the following issues:

- Allowing input of arbitrary data.
- Potentially causing bugs at runtime due to the inability to retrieve the corresponding voxel.

### Improvement Plan

Since the number of voxels in Box3 is finite, we have introduced custom types to strictly regulate the input data.

### Effect of Improvement

- Ensures data validity.
- Improves code readability.
- Enhances error-checking capabilities.

## Usage Guide

### Example Demonstration
