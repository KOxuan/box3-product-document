# Game Resource Paths

:::tip
**Reason for Modification:**
In the original d.ts file provided by the officials, the path parameters for relevant API interfaces (such as creating entities, playing audio, etc.) were uniformly declared as the `string` type.

However, when a resource does not exist, forcing the code to execute will trigger a game error.

To implement code syntax hints, we have adopted a method of synchronizing map resources to generate resource types for constraints.

## Usage Example

## Best Practices

- It is recommended to synchronize resources at the beginning of development.
- Regularly check the resource synchronization status.
- Use type constraints to avoid runtime errors.
