# Box3 React Development Guide

:::info

This framework only supports Box3 client-side development and cannot be used on the server.

:::

This guide will help you get started with Box3 React development quickly. By using React's component-based development approach, you can build and manage your game's UI more efficiently.

## Installing Dependencies

You can install the `@dao3fun/react` dependency package in the following two ways:

### Method 1: Install with the ArenaPro Plugin (Recommended)

1.  In VSCode, press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows) or `Command + Shift + P` (macOS) to open the command palette.
2.  Type "ArenaPro" and select the `ArenaPro: View Box3 NPM Packages` command.
3.  Enter `react` in the search box.
4.  Select the `@dao3fun/react` package and click "Confirm Installation" in the bottom-left corner.
5.  Wait for the installation to complete. A success message will appear in the bottom-right corner of VSCode.

### Method 2: Install with npm

Execute the following command in the project's root directory:

```bash
npm install @dao3fun/react
```

## Environment Configuration

After installation, you need to perform the following configurations to support React development:

### Configure tsconfig.json

1.  Open the `tsconfig.json` file in the project's `client` directory.
2.  Add the `jsx` configuration to `compilerOptions`:
    ```json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "jsx": "react"
        // other configurations...
      }
    }
    ```
    After this configuration, TypeScript will correctly recognize JSX syntax.

### Configure dao3.config.json

1.  Open the `dao3.config.json` file in the project's root directory.
2.  Change the `entry` to `src/clientApp.tsx`.

### Modify the Client Entry File

Due to framework reasons, you need to use a `.tsx` or `.jsx` format file as the entry file, instead of `.js` or `.ts`.

Create or modify the `clientApp.tsx` file in the `client` directory.

## Quick Start

The tag system of Box3 React is fully compatible with the Box3 UI API, for example:

- `<box />` corresponds to `UiBox`
- `<text />` corresponds to `UiText`

UI styles are set through the `style` attribute. For specific APIs, please refer to the [Box3 UI API Documentation](https://docs.box3lab.com/api/ClientUI/).

Let's look at a simple example to understand the basic usage:

```tsx
// clientApp.tsx
import React from "@dao3fun/react";

function App() {
  return <box>Hello, React</box>;
}

React.render(<App />, ui);
```

The effect is as follows:

As you can see, the rendering effect is identical to a manually created UI.

Special Note: If you use text content directly without wrapping it in a `<text />` tag, the system will automatically create a `UiText` component and display it centered by default.

Let's look at another example using the `<text />` tag:

```tsx
import React from "@dao3fun/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <box>
      <text>Hello, React</text>
    </box>
  );
}

React.render(<App />, ui);
```

The effect is as follows:

## Fragment

The `<fragment />` or `<>` tag is used to group multiple components together without creating a parent component.

```tsx
import React from "@dao3fun/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <text>Hello, React</text>
    </>
  );
}

React.render(<App />, ui);
```

The effect is as follows:
