# Creating Component Scripts

This guide will help you quickly set up and create component scripts for the Box3 Engine. Through component-based development, you can better organize and manage your game code.

## Installing the Component Library

You can install the `@dao3fun/component` library in the following two ways:

### Method 1: Install with the ArenaPro Plugin (Recommended)

1.  In the VSCode editor, press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows) or `Command + Shift + P` (macOS) to open the command palette.
2.  Search for "ArenaPro" and run the `ArenaPro: View Box3 NPM Packages` command.
3.  In the pop-up input box, enter `component` to search.
4.  Click on `@dao3fun/component`, then click "Confirm Installation" in the bottom-left pop-up.
5.  Wait for the installation to complete. A success message will appear in the bottom-right corner of VSCode.

### Method 2: Install with the npm Command Line

Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
npm install @dao3fun/component
```

## Configuring Component Templates

After installation, you can configure the feature to automatically generate component templates:

1.  Open the `dao3.config.json` file in the project's root directory.
2.  Add or modify the `ECS` configuration item:

![Configure ECS attribute](/QQ20250321-172825.png)

After configuration, a component template will be automatically generated each time you create a new `.ts` file.

## Creating Component Scripts

### Automatic Creation (Recommended)

1.  In the VSCode Explorer, right-click the directory where you want to create the script.
2.  Select "New File".
3.  Enter the file name (ending with `.ts`), such as `NewComponent.ts`.
4.  Press Enter to confirm, and the component template will be generated automatically.

### Component Template Structure

```typescript
import { _decorator, Component, EntityNode } from "@dao3fun/component";
const { apclass } = _decorator;

@apclass("NewComponent")
export class NewComponent extends Component<GameEntity> {
  // Called when the component is initialized
  start() {
    // Initialize the component here
  }

  // Called every frame
  update(deltaTime: number) {
    // Write update logic here
  }
}
```

## Development Notes

### 1. Class Name Uniqueness

- Component class names must be unique throughout the project.
- They cannot be duplicated even in different directories.
- It is recommended to use descriptive class names, such as `PlayerMovement`, `EnemyAI`, etc.

### 2. Decorator Usage

- You must use the `@apclass` decorator to define a component class.
- The decorator parameter should be consistent with the class name.
- Example:
  ```typescript
  @apclass("PlayerController")
  export class PlayerController extends Component<GameEntity> {
    // ...
  }
  ```

### 3. File Naming Conventions

- The file name should be exactly the same as the component class name.
- Use PascalCase for naming.
- For example: `PlayerController.ts`, `EnemySpawner.ts`.

### 4. Advantages of TypeScript

We strongly recommend using TypeScript to write components:

- Better type checking
- Intelligent code completion
- Easier to find potential errors
- Better code maintainability

## Frequently Asked Questions

1.  **Q: Why isn't my component template being generated automatically?**
    A: Please check if the `ECS` setting in `dao3.config.json` is correctly set to `true`.
2.  **Q: What should I do if I have duplicate component class names?**
    A: Change one of the class names to ensure that all component class names in the project are unique.
3.  **Q: How do I debug component code?**
    A: Use VSCode's debugging features, set breakpoints, and start the debugging mode.
