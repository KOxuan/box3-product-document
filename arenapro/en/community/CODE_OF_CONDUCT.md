# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

To foster an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## QQ Technical Exchange Group Regulations

Welcome to the official ArenaPro Technical Exchange Group! To jointly maintain a positive, focused, efficient, and harmonious technical communication environment, we have established the following regulations. The words and actions of every member are part of the community, and we hope we can work together to build an outstanding home for creators.

### I. Core Philosophy

1.  **💻 Focus on Technology**: Our core is **ArenaPro, Box3 development, game programming, and related AI technologies**. We encourage in-depth technical discussions but please avoid posting content that is purely about gameplay, account trading, politically sensitive, or contrary to laws and regulations.
2.  **🤝 Mutual Respect**: Every member should be respected, regardless of their technical skill level or experience. Any form of abuse, ridicule, personal attacks, or invasion of privacy is strictly prohibited. We are here to learn and grow, not to create conflict.
3.  **💡 Willingness to Share**: We encourage the sharing and dissemination of knowledge. When you receive help from the community, if you can summarize and share the solution, or proactively help other members, you will benefit the entire community.

### II. The Art of Communication: How to Communicate Efficiently

#### 📝 **About Asking Questions**

Asking questions efficiently not only gets you answers faster but also shows respect for others' time.

- **Three Steps Before Asking**:

  1.  **Check the Official Documentation**: Ensure your question doesn't already have an answer in the official docs.
  2.  **Search Chat History**: Use QQ's search function to see if someone has asked a similar question.
  3.  **Organize Your Question Clearly**: Think about how to describe your problem concisely.

- **Components of a Good Question**:

  - **Goal**: What effect are you trying to achieve?
  - **Problem**: What specific issue did you encounter? (e.g., XX function isn't working, XX module has an error)
  - **Attempts**: What solutions have you already tried?
  - **Context & Code**: Attach necessary **code snippets** (formatted as code blocks), **full error messages**, and relevant screenshots.

- **Behaviors We Discourage**:
  - Starting with meaningless greetings like "Anyone here?" or "Any experts around?".
  - Being a "help vampire" by asking for complete code without any thought or effort.
  - Repeatedly `@` mentioning the same person or `@all members` in a short period.

#### 🙌 **About Answering Questions**

- **Patience and Friendliness**: Be patient when dealing with beginner questions. Your kindness will encourage more people to participate.
- **Teach a Man to Fish**: Try to guide the questioner to think, rather than just giving the final answer. Explaining "why" is more valuable than just giving "what."
- **Constructive Feedback**: When you disagree with a viewpoint, please base your constructive discussion on technical facts.

### III. Members and Management

- **👥 Member Activity**:
  - To maintain the vitality of the community, members who have been inactive in the group for a long period (e.g., over 6 months) may be removed.
  - We encourage new members to engage in effective technical communication based on the group rules within 7 days of joining to integrate into the community.
- **🚫 No Advertising or Spamming**:
  - Any form of commercial advertising, promotional links, or unauthorized invitations to external groups is strictly prohibited.
  - Do not maliciously spam or send a large amount of irrelevant content in a short period.

### IV. Violations and Handling

- **⚠️ Handling Process**:
  - **First Offense**: An administrator will issue a **warning** and retract the relevant message.
  - **Repeated Offenses**: Will result in a **mute** for a period of **1 to 14 days**.
  - **Serious Offenses**: Such as maliciously disrupting the community atmosphere or posting severely inappropriate content, will result in being **permanently removed and blocked**.
  - **Suspected Illegal Activity**: For illegal activities, evidence will be preserved and handled according to the law.
- **Appeals and Communication**:
  - The management team has the final say on the interpretation and execution of the group rules. If you disagree with a decision, please communicate with an administrator privately and amicably.

> **Note**: These rules will be updated periodically as the community develops. The final interpretation right belongs to the management team.
