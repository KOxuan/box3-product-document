## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: Can I apply for multiple avatar frames with the same project?**

  - A: Of course! We fully support "double-dipping" and encourage continuous investment in your work. For example: ① You received the "Novice Contributor" for project A; ② You later introduced a standardized Git Flow and version management, you can then apply for the "Git Collaboration Contributor" with it; ③ If this project is later officially rated as a boutique, it can still be used as material to apply for the "Advanced Core Contributor."

- **Q: How is the "cumulative effective active days in the editor" for the "Novice Contributor" calculated?**

  - A: An "effective active day" refers to a day when you have performed **actual operations** in the ArenaPro editor (such as saving a script, editing a scene, debugging, etc.) and compiled code to the map. You do not need to be online all day; as long as there is a valid activity record for the day, it is counted as 1 active day.

- **Q: When applying for the "Git Collaboration Contributor," do I need to meet both the "Personal Project Management" and "Team Collaboration" requirements?**

  - A: No. These are parallel paths. You only need to **choose one of them** and fully meet all the verification criteria under that path to apply. We encourage you to choose the one that best suits your actual situation and project experience.

- **Q: We are a team. How are the rewards distributed?**

  - A: **We do not accept group applications on behalf of a team; all honors are awarded to individuals only.** For projects completed by a team, all members who made core contributions can apply **independently**. We primarily use the project's Git commit history to objectively evaluate each member's contribution amount and specific role. Therefore, a standardized Git commit record that reflects individual work is key to the application. When applying, please also briefly explain your main responsibilities in the team.

- **Q: What if my application is rejected?**

  - A: If your application is not approved, you can always ask the reviewing administrator for the specific reason. After making improvements based on the suggestions, you are always welcome to resubmit your application.

- **Q: Do my contributions before this plan was announced count?**
  - A: Of course! This incentive plan retroactively includes all historical contributions. As long as your contribution meets the above standards, you can apply.
